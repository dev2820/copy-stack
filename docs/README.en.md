# Copy Stack
It helps you record and recall your copy. This extension would be helpful if it was inconvenient to save only one copy at a time.


## üîßFeatures

1. Save the Text
You can select text and save it in the app through 'store to Copy Stack' in the context menu.

The generated copy lets you view the summary statement, the address where the copy was created, and the date of creation. You can copy it to the clipboard with the Copy button on the bottom and erase it with the delete button.

2. Save the Image
Images can also be saved in the app through 'store to Copy Stack' in the context menu.

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to the clipboard system's nature, it is impossible to save other types except for png. Therefore, the copied image is automatically converted to png.

3. Filter
You can change the filter at the top so that only copies of the type you want are visible. There are two types of copies, Text and Image, and you can filter the types in toggle format.

4. Detail Page
You can go to the detail page by pressing the 'show detail' button on the copy. You can view the date of creation, and the link that generated the copy.

The Detail Page about the copied text also tells you how many characters the text is in total for a text copy, and the Detail Page about the copied image tells you how big the image is for an image copy.
